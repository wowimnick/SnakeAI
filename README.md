# SnakeAI

A reinforcement learning Snake game that i wanted to make for fun and practice.

Info:
  •	As seen in the GIF, there is a graph which displays the score from the previous episodes.
  •	The model plays proficiantly after ~300 episodes, although it does have issues with it trapping itself once it gets too long.
  •	You can train your own model or test/continue training the model that was already premade.
  •	Execute the program using the agent.py file.
